# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022

I'm starting on Day 14, so I'm already way behind. This is going to be a bit of speed run. I'm doing my solutions in python using vim as my editor (because loading VS Code on a chromebook is too much hassle). So the code is a mess, but as long as it works I have no intention of fixing it.

UPDATE: I read the descriptions for 11-16 and just thought "ugh. this doesn't look fun". I'm out.
